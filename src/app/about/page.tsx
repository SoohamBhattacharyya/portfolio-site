        Hello! I&rsquo;m <strong>Sooham Bhattacharyya</strong>, a passionate educator and software developer based in India. I love teaching and helping students understand complex topics in simple ways.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently appointed as a <strong>Technical Assistant</strong> at <strong>Bishnupur Public Institute of Technology</strong>, Bishnupur, Bankura â€” well known as <strong>BPIE</strong>, a reputed polytechnic college. I assist in academic activities and support students in learning practical and theoretical concepts in the field of computer science and engineering.
        <br /><br />
        I have experience working with web technologies like <strong>React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS</strong>, and building custom software solutions. I also enjoy mentoring students, conducting workshops, and sharing resources that make learning enjoyable.
        <br /><br />
        When I&rsquo;m not coding or teaching, you&rsquo;ll find me exploring new tech tools, reading, or writing educational content to help others grow.
